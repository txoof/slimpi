# SlimPi 

## SlimPi Deprecated

SlimPi has been replaced by [PaperPi](https://github.com/txoof/PaperP), a more robust, and plugin friendly version.

## ePaper based Logitech Media Player Display
For complete build instructions and links to a spiffy case, head over to the [Project Log at Hackaday.io](https://hackaday.io/project/170051-slimpi).

## Features
<a name="features"></a>
SlimPi provides a *now playing* display for a selected Logitech Media Player. When the player is paused, an alternative screen is displayed.

<img width="500" src="./docs/SlimPi_playing.png"></img>

Display includes: 
* Track Title
* Artist Name
* Album Name
* Album Artwork (if available)
* Now Playing Mode: e.g. play, stop, pause

When the music is paused, the display shows an alternative screen.

**Word Clock** (default)

**Binary Clock**

<img width = "200" src="./docs/SlimPi_binary_clock.png">

The refresh rate of HAT compatable waveshare displays is relatively slow (5-20 seconds) and does not support partial refreshes. This results in the display pulsing between an all-white and all-black state several times during each refresh. 

To limit the visual disturbance of a pulsing screen, the default clock is the Word Clock with a refresh rate of around 5 minutes.


## Software Quick Install
<a name="quick-install)"></a>
If you have a working EPD installed, the following instructions will get you up and runing quickly. If you do not yet have a working screen installed, check the Hardware Setup instructions below.
1. Download the installable package from [git hub](https://github.com/txoof/slimpi_epd/raw/master/slimpi_latest.tgz)
2. Decompress the tarball: `tar xvzf slimpi_latest.tgz`\
3. Make sure SPI is enabled on the Raspberry Pi
3. Run the installer: 
   * `install.sh` for a daemon that starts automatically at boot, or see below for running in user space
   * `user_install.sh` to setup the user space configuration files
4. Edit the appropriate configuation file: `/etc/slimpi.cfg` for daemon or `~/.config/com.txoof.slimpi/slimpi.cfg` for user space
    * **Required** settings that must be configured:
        - `display = waveShareEPDType`
        - example: `display = epd5in83`
            * The display type should match the model number of your HAT compatable e-Paper display
        - `player_name = "Name Of LMS Player on Local Network"` 
        - example: `player_name = slimpi`
            * The player name can be found by running `slimpi --list-servers`:
            
            
        ```
        slimpi --list-servers

        Scanning for available LMS Server and players
        servers found:
        [{'host': '192.168.178.9', 'port': 9000}]

        players found:
        name: Chilab'le <---player_name
        playerid: 00:04:20:07:e6:44
        modelname: Squeezebox Classic


        players found:
        name: slimpi <---player_name
        playerid: dc:a6:32:29:99:f0
        modelname: SqueezeLite   
        ```

## Requirements
<a name="requirements"></a>
### Required Hardware
* Raspberry Pi 4 Model B
    * RPI 3 Model A should work as well, but is untested
* [WaveShare e-Paper display with e-Paper HAT](https://www.waveshare.com/product/oleds-lcds/e-paper.htm)
    * Any waveshare display should work  
    * [Supported WaveShare ePaper Displays](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/E-Paper_Driver_HAT#Resources)

### Optional Hardware
* [HiFiBerry hat](https://www.hifiberry.com/shop/#boards) (*optional*) 
    * The HiFiBerry DAC+ PRO and similar boards add high-quality audio output to the Pi so it can act as a display and also work as a LMS client player using squeezelite
    * GPIO 2x20 headers **must be added** to the board to support WaveShare HAT
    * HiFiBerry's [DAC+ Bundle](https://www.hifiberry.com/shop/bundles/hifiberry-dac-bundle-4/) with the following configuraiton is a good choice:
        * DAC+ Pro 
        * Acrylic Case for (RCA) AND DIGI+
        * Raspberry Pi 4B 2GB (1GB should be sufficient as well)
        * 16GB SD Card
        * PowerSupply (USB C 5.1V/3A)
        * 2x20 Pin Male Header (required for WaveShare HAT)

### Required Raspberry Pi Configuration:
Enable SPI
```
$ sudo raspi-config
```
Select *Interfacing Options > SPI* and set to *Yes*

### Required Software
* [Logitech Media Server](http://wiki.slimdevices.com/index.php/Logitech_Media_Server) running on local network
    * An LMS instance can be run on the Raspberry Pi - [Home Hack - Creating a Raspberry Pi Squeezebox server](https://homehack.nl/creating-a-raspberry-pi-squeezebox-server/) 

### Optional Software
* [squeezelite](http://wiki.slimdevices.com/index.php/Squeezelite) *(optional)*
    * Squeezelite, in combination with a HiFiBerry, allows the Pi to be usded as LMS display **and** client player

  Note: to make squeezelite play nice with other applications such as raspotify (librespot), add the following line to /etc/default/squeezelite:

    `SB_EXTRA_ARGS="-C 10"`

  This will allow squeezelite to close the output device after 10 seconds allowing other audio software to access it.
